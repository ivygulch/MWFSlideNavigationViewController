### About MWFSlideNavigationViewController

MWFSlideNavigationViewController is a container view controller that manages primary and secondary view controller. Primary view controller is the root view controller initialized with the controller. While the secondary controller's view is 'hidden' beneath the primary/root, It's revealed by sliding the primary/root view in one of the 4 directions supported (up, left, down, right). 

It works similar to the Facebook iPhone app, a menu view is revealed when user taps on the menu button. Or in the Piggie app, shortcut buttons view is revealed when user taps the lightning button.

### How to use

Read the <a href="http://meiwinfu.com/2012/01/28/os1/">blog post</a> for quick overview.
Sample codes are provided in the Demo folder inside the project.

#### Basic Usage

* Initialize the controller with your root controller.

  ```objective-c
  MWFSlideNavigationViewController * ctl = [[MWFSlideNavigationViewController alloc] initWithRootViewController:yourRootViewController];`
  ```

* Assign delegate and dataSource

  ```objective-c
  // in your root view controller
  - (void) viewDidLoad 
  {
     [super viewDidLoad];
     self.slideNavigationViewController.delegate = self;
     self.slideNavigationViewController.dataSource = self;
  }
  ```

* Trigger the slide animation, e.g. revealing menu on the left (will perform slide animation with right direction)

  ```objective-c
  // your action method, e.g. in your root view controller
  - (IBAction) showMenu:(id)sender
  {
     [self.slideNavigationViewController slideWithDirection:MWFSlideDirectionRight];
  }
  ```

* Slide the primary/root view back to conceal the secondary view.

  ```objective-c
  // your action method, e.g. in your root view controller
  - (IBAction) closeMenu:(id)sender
  {
     [self.slideNavigationViewController slideWithDirection:MWFSlideDirectionNone];
  }
  ```

* Implementing Delegate

  ```objective-c
  - (NSInteger) slideNavigationViewController:(MWFSlideNavigationViewController *)controller 
                     distanceForSlideDirecton:(MWFSlideDirection)direction 
                          portraitOrientation:(BOOL)portraitOrientation
  {
    if (portraitOrientation)
    {
       return 180;
    }
    else
    {
       return 100;
    }
  }
  ```
  
* Implementing DataSource

  ```objective-c
  - (UIViewController *) slideNavigationViewController:(MWFSlideNavigationViewController *)controller 
                        viewControllerForSlideDirecton:(MWFSlideDirection)direction
  {
     YourMenuViewController * menuCtl = ...; // alloc and init your controller
     return menuCtl;
  }
  ```
  
* Enable sliding with pan/swipe gesture

  ```objective-c
     slideNavigationController.panEnabled = YES;
  ```
